# web-scraping-ecowiser

## **Summary [Web Automation]**

I am grateful for the chance to work on an assignment that involves scraping LinkedIn data. However, after reading through LinkedIn's terms and conditions, I learned that it is against the law to collect data from its platform using any automated means. I therefore chose not to complete the task in order to avoid any possible consequences. Despite this, I still want to demonstrate my abilities, and I would welcome the chance to work on another assignment. I appreciate Ecowiser giving me this fantastic opportunity and hope to work with them again in the future.

## **Summary [LinkedIn API]**

I let Ecowiser know that since LinkedIn's policies call for express authorization for most permissions and partner programmes, I am unable to use the LinkedIn API for the specified work. I tried many approaches and got assistance from many people, but I couldn't solve the problem. I have therefore chosen not to use the LinkedIn API in order to prevent any possible consequences. I still want to prove my ability, though, so I ask for another task. I apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused and state that I would be open to talking about other options. I am grateful for the chance Ecowiser has given me and am looking forward to working with them again in the future.
